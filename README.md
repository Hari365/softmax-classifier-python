# softmax-classifier-python
A python implementation of the softmax classifier<br><br>
This Repository contains a implementation of softmax classifier which is used for multi class classification. Three different stoping criteria can be used to stop the training. Most computations are vectorized avoiding for loops. Feel free to pull and improve on this.
